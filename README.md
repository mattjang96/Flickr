# Shuttr

[Live Link](https://shuttr.herokuapp.com/)

Shuttr is a photo sharing website inspired by [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/). It has Rails/PostgreSQL as its backend frameworks, and React.js and Redux as its frontend frameworks.

Shuttr was designed and implemented within a 10-day timeframe. Regardless, this is still an ongoing project, with more features left to be implemented. 

Thanks for visiting!
